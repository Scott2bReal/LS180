Load this file into your database.

   1. What does the file do?

    This file will issue SQL commands to a database when piped to the `psql` program

   2. What is the output of the command? What does each line in this output mean?

    The output of the command is:
    ```
    NOTICE:  table "films" does not exist, skipping
    DROP TABLE
    CREATE TABLE
    INSERT 0 1
    INSERT 0 1
    INSERT 0 1
    ```

    These are responses to SQL statements. Because there is not table "films",
    no table is actually dropped, but `psql` still acknowledges the statements
    with the `DROP TABLE`. Then `CREATE TABE` means just that, that a table has
    been created. After this, the 3 lines with `INSERT` means that rows have
    been added to the database, and the numbers indicate the amount of rows
    added.

   3. Open up the file and look at its contents. What does the first line do?

    The first line checks to see if a table named `films` exists in the database.
