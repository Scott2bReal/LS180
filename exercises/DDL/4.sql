/*
For many of the closest stars, we know the distance from Earth fairly
accurately; for instance, Proxima Centauri is roughly 4.3 light years away.
Our database, as currently defined, only allows integer distances, so the
most accurate value we can enter is 4. Modify the distance column in the
stars table so that it allows fractional light years to any degree of
precision required.

Assume the stars table already contains one or more rows of data. What
will happen when you try to run the above command? To test this, revert
the modification and add a row or two of data:
